The purpose of this project is to learn how to integrate an interatice AI feature along with an emotion detector. Within the **practice_projects** I learned how to create an emotion detector, using live feed and an image. I also learned how to create an API Key and how to use it to call **geminai** ai. 

The final project is located in the main folder titled **AI_Live_Emotion_Detector.py**.
